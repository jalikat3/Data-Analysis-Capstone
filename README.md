# DataAnalysisCapstone
This is the code that I used in order to analyze the data in my Big Data Analytics Capstone, which is focused on analyzing an existing list of website accessibility lawsuits in order to pull out trends with data analysis tools, and create visual analytics for presentation purposes.

# Contents
Included are python code used to create the web scraper, some csv outputs from MySQL queries, and python visual analysis code.
More will be updated soon!
